  <h2>Creating an Icon</h2>
  <p>
  <img src="/images/editor.png" align="right" width="310" height="266">
  A central part of using Icon Forth is creating icons to represent the words
  or ideas you are constructing. The images are 16x16 pixels in size and have a
  very restricted set of ten colors. This limited canvas is intended to provide
  you just enough space to uniquely represent a word. By limiting the range of
  colors and the size of the icon, you are encouraged to create images which are
  simple and thrifty.
  </p>
  <p>
  The image editor has all you need to create simple icons. Two views of your
  icon are presented: normal size and zoomed. At any time, the current pen color
  is selected from the palette on the right, and marked with a white circle.
  Draw on the icon my clicking or dragging inside the zoomed view.
  </p>
  <h2>Describing Your Word</h2>
  <p>

  While an icon will allow you to recognize your word at a glance, it may be
  hard to locate in a sea of other icons. Additionally, people unfamiliar with
  your word may not fully grasp the meaning of your word. The description area
  is your opportunity to document and comment on your word. Use it to describe
  what the word does, when to use it, and possibly a short simple name by which
  it can be referred to verbally. A word's description is the only means by
  which you can later perform a text search to locate the word.
  </p>
  <h2>Defining Your Word</h2>
  <p>
  <img src="/images/results.png" align="right" width="270" height="305">
  Words in Icon Forth are defined in terms of other words. The current
  definition of your word appears directly about the search box. To add words to
  the definition you must first locate them. This can be done using the gray
  region of the editor. Initially, a view containing words you have recently
  defined along with a mixture of popular words, will appear in the gray area.
  If you do no see the word you are looking for, enter a keyword from the word
  you are interested in finding, and click 'Search'. At any time you can get
  back to the overview list of words by click on 'All'.
  </p>
  <p>
  <img src="/images/read.png" align="left" width="270" height="296">
  You can explore a word by clicking on it. The gray region will then fill with
  a variety of information about the currently selected word. The word's icon
  will appear with a red border around it. Below that the definition of the word
  will appear, followed by the description text entered when the word was
  created. If the word is used elsewhere, a list of the most popular words
  containing it will appear. Information about when a word was created and last
  used in a definition will also appear.
  </p>
  <p>
  Any time you see an icon, you can click on it for
  information about that word. The 'List' button will open a new tab or window
  containing the definition of the current word, followed by all other relevant
  definitions. The 'Run' button will execute the current word, allowing you to
  try it out. If you created a word and were logged in at the time, you can
  later delete the word with the 'Delete' button. Any words while already use
  your word will continue to function, but no new words will incorporate it.
