  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
  A picture is said to be worth a thousand words.
  Icon Forth is an experiment in what can happen when traditional
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a>
  words are replaced with images and the
  dictionary becomes an online collaborative database.
  </p>
  <p>
  In Icon Forth, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a> definition like:
  <h3>: square dup * ;</h3>
  becomes:
  <h3>
    <img class="icon" src="/icon?id=aglpY29uZm9ydGhyCwsSBFdvcmQY9zYM.png">:
    <img class="icon" src="/icon?id=aglpY29uZm9ydGhyCwsSBFdvcmQY8DYM.png" border="0"><img class="icon" src="/icon?id=aglpY29uZm9ydGhyCwsSBFdvcmQY7ScM.png" border="0">
  </h3>
  </p>
  <p>
  Each 16x16 icon, pictographically depicts what the it means, and icons
  are strung together to construct more complex concepts from simpler
  ones.
  </p>
  <p>
  Icon Forth, like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wiki</a>,
  is a collaborative development space. Anyone can add an icon, and anyone
  can use and explorer the icons added by others. This user guide will get you
  started.
  It will teach you how to use the Icon Forth
  <a href="/editor">Editor</a> to explorer existing icons in the global
  dictionary, or how to create icons of your own.
  A <a href="/html/glossary.html">glossary</a> describing the core icons
  in the system is also included for reference.
  </p>
  <h2>Optional Login</h2>
  <p>
  You can use Icon Forth either anonymously, or by logging in with your Google
  Account (such as a gmail account). At this time, the only advantage to logging
  in is that you will have the option to delete icons you have created. For
  privacy purposes, the icons you create are not marked as such. Depending on
  interest, in the future, the icons you create may be labeled and possibly
  modifiable.
  </p>
  <h2>Creating an Icon</h2>
  <p>
  <img class="snapshot"
  src="/images/editor.png" align="right" width="310" height="266">
  A central part of using Icon Forth is creating icons to represent the actions
  or ideas your are describing to the system. The images are 16x16 pixels in
  size and have a
  very restricted set of ten colors. This limited canvas is intended to provide
  you just enough space to uniquely represent an idea. By limiting the range of
  colors and the size of the icon, you are encouraged to create images which are
  simple and thrifty.
  </p>
  <p>
  The image editor has all you need to create simple icons. Two views of your
  icon are presented: normal size and zoomed. At any time, the current pen color
  is selected from the palette on the right, and marked with a white circle.
  Draw on the icon my clicking or dragging inside the zoomed view.
  </p>
  <h2>Describing Your Icon</h2>
  <p>
  <img class="snapshot"
  src="/images/description.png" align="left" width="231" height="141">
  While its appearance will allow you to recognize your icon at a glance,
  it may nonetheless be hard to locate in a sea of other icons. Additionally,
  people unfamiliar with your icon may not fully grasp its meaning.
  The description area
  is your opportunity to document and comment on your icon. Use it to describe
  what the icon does, when to use it, and possibly a short simple name by which
  it can be referred to verbally. An icon's description is the only means by
  which you can later perform a text search to locate the icon.
  </p>
  <h2>Defining Your Icon</h2>
  <p>
  <img class="snapshot"
  src="/images/results.png" align="right" width="270" height="305">
  Icons in Icon Forth are defined in terms of other icons. The current
  definition of your icon appears directly about the search box. To add icons to
  the definition you must first locate them. This can be done using the gray
  region of the editor. Initially, a view containing icons you have recently
  defined along with a mixture of popular icons, will appear in the gray area.
  If you do no see the icon you are looking for, enter a keyword related to the
  icon you are interested in finding, and click 'Search'. At any time you can
  get back to the overview list of icons by click on 'All'.
  </p>
  <p>
  You can explore an icon by clicking on it. The gray region will then fill with
  a variety of information about the currently selected icon. The icon
  will appear with a red border around it. Below that the definition of the icon
  will appear, followed by the description text entered when the icon was
  created. If the icon is used elsewhere, a list of the most popular icons
  containing it will appear. Information about when an icon was created and last
  used in a definition will also appear.
  </p>
  <p>
  <img class="snapshot"
  src="/images/read.png" align="left" width="270" height="296">
  Any time you see an icon, you can click on it for
  information about that icon. The 'List' button will open a new tab or window
  containing the definition of the current icon, followed by all other relevant
  definitions. The 'Run' button will execute the current icon, allowing you to
  try it out. If you created an icon and were logged in at the time, you can
  later delete the icon with the 'Delete' button. Any icons which already use
  your icon will continue to function, but no new icons can incorporate it once
  it has been deleted.
